## Overview of the Project

The ToDoListOrganizer project is an AI-powered to-do list organizer with quantum capabilities. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, editing, marking complete, deleting, and categorizing tasks into different projects. The project also includes advanced features such as FfeD framework integration, quantum functions, and phi framework integration.

## Key Features and Functionalities

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, mark complete, and delete tasks.
- **Project Categorization**: Group tasks into different projects for better organization.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login.
- **FfeD Framework Integration**: Advanced listing, prediction, and information gathering.
- **Quantum Functions**: Various quantum functions and their interactions within the application.
- **Phi Framework Integration**: Calculations related to rotation speed, Foucaultâ€™s pendulum, and Coriolis force.

## Note on FfeD Algorithm

Please protect the FfeD algorithm but share as much knowledge on the phi framework. The rest is all free to be shared, but because of the FfeD framework, it cannot be used for selling this tool. It is free to use, install, and share, but no profit can be made without my consent. Free open source can use this tool to build other tools but cannot include the code part with the FfeD algorithm I developed. Anyone who wants to use the algorithm needs to contact and communicate with neural_network@brain.scrde.ca. Otherwise, everything else is free to use or sell, including the mathematics in the phi framework.
