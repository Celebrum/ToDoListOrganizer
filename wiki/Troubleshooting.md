# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Application Fails to Start
**Solution**: Ensure that all dependencies are installed correctly. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Also, make sure that the virtual environment is activated:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Issue: Database Connection Error
**Solution**: Verify that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set correctly in the `.env` file. For SQLite, it should be:
```env
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///database.db
```
For PostgreSQL, it should be:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/tododb
```

### Issue: JWT Token Generation Error
**Solution**: Ensure that the `JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set correctly in the `.env` file. Generate a secure random key and set it as follows:
```env
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret-key
```

### Issue: Missing Environment Variables
**Solution**: Ensure that all required environment variables are defined in the `.env` file. Refer to the [Configuration](Configuration.md) section for a list of required environment variables.

### Issue: API Endpoint Not Working
**Solution**: Verify that the API endpoint is defined correctly in the `app.py` file and that the corresponding route is implemented. Check the [API Documentation](API_Documentation.md) for the correct endpoint details.

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check Logs**: Review the application logs for any error messages or stack traces. Logs can provide valuable information about the cause of the issue.
2. **Use Debugger**: Use a debugger to step through the code and identify the source of the problem. Visual Studio Code provides built-in debugging tools that can be helpful.
3. **Print Statements**: Add print statements to the code to output variable values and track the flow of execution. This can help identify where the issue is occurring.
4. **Unit Tests**: Run unit tests to verify that individual components of the application are working correctly. Refer to the [Running Tests](Getting_Started.md#running-tests) section for instructions on running tests.
5. **Consult Documentation**: Refer to the project documentation and wiki for guidance on configuration, setup, and usage. The documentation can provide insights into common issues and their solutions.

## Note on FfeD Algorithm

Please protect the FfeD algorithm but share as much knowledge on the phi framework. The rest is all free to be shared, but because of the FfeD framework, it cannot be used for selling this tool. It is free to use, install, and share, but no profit can be made without my consent. Free open source can use this tool to build other tools but cannot include the code part with the FfeD algorithm I developed. Anyone who wants to use the algorithm needs to contact and communicate with neural_network@brain.scrde.ca. Otherwise, everything else is free to use or sell, including the mathematics in the phi framework.
