# Personal To-Do List Organizer

## Description
A simple personal To-Do List Organizer that allows users to add, edit, mark complete, delete, and categorize tasks into different projects.

## Core Features

### Task Management
- Add new tasks.
- Edit task descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Delete tasks.

### Project Categorization
- Allow tasks to be grouped into projects (e.g., "Work", "Home", "Study").

### User Authentication
- Users can register and login to access their tasks securely.

## Specific Requirements

- Users must be able to create an account and access their tasks.
- Tasks can have attributes like title, due date, and priority.
- Allow categorizing tasks into projects for better organization.
- The app should be modular to allow future upgrades.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- JWT

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/githubnext/workspace-blank.git
   cd workspace-blank
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application
1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
   ```
   cd src
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### Running Tests
1. Navigate to the `tests` directory:
   ```
   cd tests
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```
   python -m unittest discover
   ```

### FfeD Framework Setup and Usage

The FfeD (Fractal Fibonacci elliptic Derivative) framework has been integrated into the application to perform advanced listing and prediction, automatically search for content and ideas, and scrape content with 75% certainty.

#### Setup

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. The FfeD framework is integrated within the `src/main.py`, `src/task_manager.py`, and `src/project_manager.py` files.

#### Usage

- The FfeD framework is automatically invoked when adding new tasks or projects.
- It performs advanced listing and prediction to enhance task and project management.
- The framework searches for relevant content and ideas to accelerate the process of gathering information.
- It scrapes content with 75% certainty to provide accurate and relevant data.

For more details on the FfeD framework, refer to the implementation in the respective source files.
