   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. The FfeD framework is integrated within the `src/main.py`, `src/task_manager.py`, and `src/project_manager.py` files.

#### Usage

- The FfeD framework is automatically invoked when adding new tasks or projects.
- It performs advanced listing and prediction to enhance task and project management.
- The framework searches for relevant content and ideas to accelerate the process of gathering information.
- It scrapes content with 75% certainty to provide accurate and relevant data.

For more details on the FfeD framework, refer to the implementation in the respective source files.

## Data Center Creation Mechanism Using Microsoft Apps

### Overview

The data center creation mechanism leverages Microsoft Access, OneDrive, Excel, Design, and Sway in a loop to automate data handling and document creation. Power Automate is used to manage the workflow, including database updates, device management, and application control.

### Steps

1. **Align Microsoft Apps**: Use Microsoft Access, OneDrive, Excel, Design, and Sway in a loop to automate data handling and document creation.
2. **Power Automate**: Set up Power Automate to manage the workflow, including database updates, device management, and application control.
3. **Database Setup**: Create and manage databases using Microsoft Access. For example:
   - `feed_origine.accdb`
   - `second_origine.accdb`
   - `origine_second.accdb`
   - `central_data.accdb`
4. **Automation Loop**: Implement a loop in Power Automate to continuously process and update data:
   - Start with Power Automate
   - Loop through device manager and application center
   - Input the 5 random apps (Access, OneDrive, Excel, Design, Sway)
   - Use in-out gates in a ladder manner to manage data flow
5. **Content Generation Rule**: Use GPT-2 to generate content based on the rule: "Compose a document on the last saved entry, the subject needs to be the opposite of the synonym of the last subject."
6. **Data Validation**: Periodically validate and clean the data to ensure accuracy and relevance before storing it in the central database.
7. **Integration with GPT-2**: Use GPT-2 for content generation. Set up a Google Colab environment to train and run the model.
8. **MindsDB Integration**: Use MindsDB for predictive analysis and to enhance the automation process.

### Power Automate Setup

1. **Create Power Automate Flow**: Set up a Power Automate flow to handle database updates, device management, and application control.
2. **Implement Loop**: Implement the loop in Power Automate to continuously process and update data.
3. **Integrate with Microsoft Access**: Use Power Automate to connect to your Microsoft Access databases and automate data handling based on the generated text.

### GPT-2 Integration

1. **Set up GPT-2 Environment**: Use Google Colab to set up a working environment for GPT-2. Clone the GPT-2 repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. **Create Flask API**: Develop a Flask API to serve the GPT-2 model. This API will handle requests from Power Automate and return generated text.
3. **Deploy Flask API**: Deploy the Flask API on a cloud service like Heroku or AWS to make it accessible to Power Automate.
4. **Process API Response**: In Power Automate, process the response from the Flask API and use the generated text in your workflow.

### Data Validation

1. **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data before processing it.
2. **Database Constraints**: Use database constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints in your Microsoft Access databases to enforce data integrity at the database level.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Implement data cleaning routines to remove or correct invalid data.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your automation scripts to catch and handle exceptions gracefully.
5. **Data Validation Functions**: Create dedicated data validation functions to check the consistency and accuracy of the data.
6. **Automated Tests**: Write unit and integration tests to verify the correctness of your data validation logic.
7. **Periodic Audits**: Schedule periodic audits to review and validate the data in your databases.

By following these steps, you can create a self-sustaining data center that continuously generates and updates content with minimal manual intervention.

### Phi Framework Integration

- The phi framework is automatically invoked when performing calculations for rotation speed, Foucault’s pendulum, and Coriolis force.
- It incorporates phi-based calculations to provide more precise results.

For more details on the phi framework, refer to the implementation in the `src/ffed_framework.py` file.

## Detailed Descriptions of Phi Framework Functions

### Rotation Speed Calculation

#### `rotation_speed(latitude)`
- Calculates the rotation speed based on the given latitude using phi-based calculations.

### Foucault’s Pendulum Calculation

#### `foucault_pendulum(latitude)`
- Calculates the period of Foucault’s pendulum based on the given latitude using phi-based calculations.

### Coriolis Force Calculation

#### `coriolis_force(latitude)`
- Calculates the Coriolis force based on the given latitude using phi-based calculations.

### Time Adjustments for ϕ-Periodicity

#### `time_adjustments(T)`
- Adjusts the given time for ϕ-periodicity.

### Latitude Scaling

#### `latitude_scaling(latitude)`
- Scales the given latitude incorporating ϕ-harmonics for fractal oscillations.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the phi framework is fully integrated and enhances the application's capabilities.
