## Note on FfeD Algorithm

Please protect the FfeD algorithm but share as much knowledge on the phi framework. The rest is all free to be shared, but because of the FfeD framework, it cannot be used for selling this tool. It is free to use, install, and share, but no profit can be made without my consent. Free open source can use this tool to build other tools but cannot include the code part with the FfeD algorithm I developed. Anyone who wants to use the algorithm needs to contact and communicate with neural_network@brain.scrde.ca. Otherwise, everything else is free to use or sell, including the mathematics in the phi framework.
