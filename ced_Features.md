# Advanced Features

## FfeD Framework Integration

The FfeD (Fractal Fibonacci elliptic Derivative) framework has been integrated into the application to perform advanced listing and prediction, automatically search for content and ideas, and scrape content with 75% certainty.

### Setup

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. The FfeD framework is integrated within the `src/main.py`, `src/task_manager.py`, and `src/project_manager.py` files.

### Usage

- The FfeD framework is automatically invoked when adding new tasks or projects.
- It performs advanced listing and prediction to enhance task and project management.
- The framework searches for relevant content and ideas to accelerate the process of gathering information.
- It scrapes content with 75% certainty to provide accurate and relevant data.

For more details on the FfeD framework, refer to the implementation in the respective source files.

## Quantum Functions

The application includes various quantum functions to enhance its capabilities. These functions are implemented in the `src/quantum_functions.py` file.

- `mitigate_errors(quantum_state)`: Mitigates errors in the given quantum state.
- `fundamental_constants()`: Returns fundamental constants used in quantum mechanics.
- `detect_quantum_signals(signal_strength)`: Detects quantum signals based on the given signal strength.
- `simulate_quantum_system(initial_state)`: Simulates a quantum system starting from the given initial state.
- `control_state(quantum_state, control_parameters)`: Controls the quantum state based on the given control parameters.

- `measure_complexity(quantum_algorithm)`: Measures the complexity of the given quantum algorithm.

## Phi Framework Integration

The phi framework has been integrated into the application to enhance the precision of calculations for rotation speed, Foucault’s pendulum, and Coriolis force.

### Setup

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. The phi framework is integrated within the `src/ffed_framework.py` file.

### Usage

- The phi framework is automatically invoked when performing calculations for rotation speed, Foucault’s pendulum, and Coriolis force.
- It incorporates phi-based calculations to provide more precise results.

For more details on the phi framework, refer to the implementation in the `src/ffed_framework.py` file.

### Functions

- `rotation_speed(latitude)`: Calculates the rotation speed based on the given latitude using phi-based calculations.
- `foucault_pendulum(latitude)`: Calculates the period of Foucault’s pendulum based on the given latitude using phi-based calculations.
- `coriolis_force(latitude)`: Calculates the Coriolis force based on the given latitude using phi-based calculations.
- `time_adjustments(T)`: Adjusts the given time for ϕ-periodicity.
- `latitude_scaling(latitude)`: Scales the given latitude incorporating ϕ-harmonics for fractal oscillations.

## Note on FfeD Algorithm

Please protect the FfeD algorithm but share as much knowledge on the phi framework. The rest is all free to be shared, but because of the FfeD framework, it cannot be used for selling this tool. It is free to use, install, and share, but no profit can be made without my consent. Free open source can use this tool to build other tools but cannot include the code part with the FfeD algorithm I developed. Anyone who wants to use the algorithm needs to contact and communicate with neural_network@brain.scrde.ca. Otherwise, everything else is free to use or sell, including the mathematics in the phi framework.
